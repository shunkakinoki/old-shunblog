## STRATEGY REPORT

### DIRECTION

WHAT CAN I SAY I'VE GROWN THIS MUCH IN JUNE?

HOW HAS MY LIFE CHANGED IN JUNE?

PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

I'VE LOST SIGHT OF THE LIFE MISSION,

BECOME PREMATURELY OBESESSED IN NOT IMPORTANT MATTERS.

HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO ME AT THE PRESENT MOMENT.

### FOCAL POINT

MAYBE WORK???

THERE ARE A LOT A LOT A LOT

MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS THAT I HAVE TO TACKLE ON.

### LONG TERM VISION

I WAS ON THE VERGE OF LOSING IT,

BUT I HUNG ON.

JUST GO FOR IT BABY.

I ONLY HAVE ONE SHOT AT THIS.
